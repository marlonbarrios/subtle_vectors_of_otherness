## About the Installation

**Subtle Vectors of Otherness** is a critical media art installation designed for art exhibitions that generates ongoing philosophical reasoning about microaggressions and subtle forms of discrimination. The work illuminates how seemingly innocent interactions can perpetuate systems of oppression and provides practical wisdom for recognizing and addressing these patterns.

This installation is part of **Pangea_IA**, a collaborative project developed in partnership with **Maria Luisa Angulo** that explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, cultural identity, and critical discourse in contemporary digital art practices.

This interactive installation generates real-time philosophical reasoning about different types of microaggressions‚Äîracial, gender, sexuality, class, disability, age, religion, nationality, body size, neurodiversity, and educational hierarchies. Each generation provides concrete examples, explains psychological impacts, and offers actionable guidance for recognition and response. The work operates across 70+ languages and prioritizes diverse global perspectives on subtle discrimination.
