## About the Installation

**Subtle Vectors of Otherness** is a critical media art installation designed for art exhibitions that explores the origins and mechanisms of racism, colonialism, and oppression. The work examines how language‚Äîeven when it appears neutral or beneficial‚Äîcan carry hidden vectors of otherness that create division and exclusion.

This installation is part of **Pangea_IA**, a collaborative project developed in partnership with **Maria Luisa Angulo** that explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, cultural identity, and critical discourse in contemporary digital art practices.

This interactive installation presents historical and contemporary quotes from leaders, thinkers, and public figures, accompanied by critical analysis that reveals the subtle ways these statements contribute to systems of oppression. The work prioritizes voices and perspectives from the Global South, Indigenous communities, and marginalized populations to provide a comprehensive understanding of how otherness operates across cultures and contexts.

## Concept

The installation reveals how oppression operates through language at multiple levels:

- **Overt vs. Subtle Oppression**: While some statements are clearly harmful, others appear reasonable or even beneficial while still carrying discriminatory implications
- **Intersectionality**: Examining how different forms of oppression (race, gender, sexuality, class, disability, religion, age, nationality, etc.) intersect and compound
- **Global Perspective**: Prioritizing diverse sources from Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Indigenous communities, and postcolonial contexts
- **Critical Analysis**: Each quote is accompanied by educational context that explains why and how it generates otherness

## Artist Statement

"Subtle Vectors of Otherness" invites viewers to examine the hidden mechanisms through which language creates division. By revealing the subtle ways that seemingly innocent statements can perpetuate systems of exclusion, the work challenges audiences to develop more critical media literacy and cultural awareness.

The installation prioritizes voices from the Global South and marginalized communities, countering the dominance of Western perspectives in discussions of oppression and otherness. Through multilingual presentation and culturally sensitive analysis, the work demonstrates how these mechanisms operate across different cultural contexts.
